# Available modules (uncomment to use):

dk use: cram                  # run tests using the "cram" functional test tool
dk use: entr-watch            # watch files and re-run tests or other commands

dk use: bash32                # enable doing tests/console/etc. in bash3.2 w/docker

# Define overrides, new commands, functions, etc. here:

dk.build() {
